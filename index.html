<h4>Responsibilities of a web developer:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Write web pages with a combination of markup languages.</li>
<li>Create quality mockups and prototypes.</li>
<li>Build a WordPress site from scratch.</li>
<li>Understand HTML and CSS.</li>
<li>Develop functional and appealing websites and web-based applications.</li>
</ol>

<article>
These are the most common requirements, but your responsibilities and tasks will vary depending on the web development gig as well as your web development specialty.

Speaking of web development specialties, there are three that you should be aware of:

Frontend development: The “frontend” refers to “stuff” on a website that you see and interact with, e.g. menus, dropdowns, etc.
Backend development: The “backend” is like the portion of the iceberg below the surface. Without it, the website can’t function. The backend deals with servers, applications, databases, etc.
Full-stack development: This is the combination of both backend and frontend development.
